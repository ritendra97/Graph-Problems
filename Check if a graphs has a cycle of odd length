//Check if a graphs has a cycle of odd length
//IN THIS QUESTION HE ASKED CHECK WHETHER THE GRAPH HSA CYCLE OR NOT IT MEANS THAT WE CAN USE BIPARTIATE GRAPH ALGORITHM
//A GRAPH IS CALLED BIPARTITE IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO SPLIT IT'S VERTICES IN TWO SETS OF MATUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE VERTICES SUCH THAT ALL EDGES ARE ACROSS SETS.
SO WE CAN SAY THAT IS YOU GET TRUE THAT MEANS THERE IS NOT ANY ODD CYCLE EITHER YOU WILL GET TRUE.
